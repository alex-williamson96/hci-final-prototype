# CS6750-Final-Prototype
This is the final prototype for our HCI group project with Alex Williamson, Ezra Engel, and Mike Bu.

We designed our prototype based upon our form initial prototype.

**Running Locally**
To run locally, you will need to clone this project onto your computer. I would suggest using HTTPS
to close because setting up Georgia Tech's ssh stuff is annoying unless you have GitHub desktop, which
support enterprise.

Once the project is cloned, `cd` into the `final-prototype-frontend` folder. If you do not have Node installed,
[visit the Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) to install it.

Run `npm install` which should install all dependencies on your local machine.

Once `npm install has finished running`, run `npm run dev` which will spin up a live reload server to run the application on.

For the best viewing experience, I would suggest going into your browser's dev tools and setting the view to mobile.
